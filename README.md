# ProjectFour - Phrase Hunter Game

A recreation of the classic "Hangman" game (or the basic premise of Wheel of Fortune without the wheel - whatever you want to call it). 
Players select keys to guess the letters - previously guessed letters change color. 
A customizable timer has been added for additional challenge, but a hint displays after 50% of the time has gone. After 80% of the time has passed, the hint and timer turn red.
There's also a slight pause after the user guesses the final correct letter so they can see the phrase before the "Win" overlay displays.
